Contribution Guidelines

    To add, remove, or change things on the list: Submit a pull request

To set this list apart from and complement the excellent Odin wiki Projects page, awesome-odin is a specially curated list for high-quality, actively maintained Odin packages and resources.

    List items should be sorted alphabetically.
    Each item should be limited to one link.
    The link should be the name of the package or project.
    Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional.
    Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line and end with a punctuation mark.
    At least 3 items are needed to create a new category.

Please contribute links to packages/projects you have used or are familiar with. This will help ensure high-quality entries.

If you removed our PR template you can find it here.
Quality standards

To be on the list, project repositories should adhere to these quality standards:

    Code functions as documented and expected
    Generally useful to the wider community of Odin programmers
    Actively maintained
        Regular, recent commits
        Or, for finished projects, issues and pull requests are responded to
    Stable or progressing toward stable
    Thoroughly documented (README, godoc comments, etc.) in english language, so everyone is able to understand the project's intention and how it works
    Tests, where practical. If the library/program is testable, then coverage should be >= 80% for non-data-related packages and >=90% for data related packages. Notice: the tests will be reviewed too. We will check your coverage manually if your package's coverage is just a benchmark results.

Thanks everyone!
